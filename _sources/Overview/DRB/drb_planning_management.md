# DRB Planning & Management

The Delaware River Basin is a critical water resource in the United States, serving a diverse range of water users and playing a significant role in the region's economy, ecology, and quality of life. This page provides an overview of the state and history of regulated water resource planning and management in the basin, highlighting key events, organizations, and initiatives that have shaped the basin's water management landscape.

## Water Resource Planning & Management

The Delaware River Basin is home to a wide variety of water users, including residential, agricultural, industrial, and recreational stakeholders. The basin provides drinking water to over 13.5 million people, supports a thriving agricultural sector, and sustains numerous manufacturing and energy production facilities.

### The 1960s Drought and the Delaware River Basin Compact

In the early 1960s, the Delaware River Basin experienced a severe drought that highlighted the need for coordinated management of water resources across state lines. The drought led to significant decreases in water levels in the basinâ€™s reservoirs, threatening water supplies for millions of people in the region.

The drought served as a catalyst for the establishment of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) which consists of New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York City. The DRBC serves as an interstate-federal regulatory agency responsible for the development of coordinated, basin-wide water resource planning and management strategies.

The DRBC's mission as outlined in the Delaware River Basin Compact is:
> "the conservation, utilization, development, management and control of water and related resources of the Delaware River Basin under a comprehensive multipurpose plan to bring the greatest benefits and produce the most efficient service in the public welfare." ([Delaware River Basin Compact](https://www.nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/compact.pdf), 1961)

In alignment with this mission, the DRBC's work encompasses a broad range of activities, including water quality management, water supply allocation, flood and drought mitigation, and ecosystem preservation.


#### The Flexible Flow Management Program

The Flexible Flow Management Program (FFMP) is a significant initative by the DRBC aimed at optimizing the operation of reservoirs in the basin to balance the diverse needs of water users while minimizing environmental impacts. The program, developed in collaboration with basin stakeholders, employs a dynamic approach to reservoir releases that considers factors such as water supply demands, ecological requirements, and seasonal variations. The FFMP has been instrumental in enhancing the basin's resilience to droughts and other hydrologic challenges, promoting interagency collaboration, and fostering adaptive water management strategies.


To achieve their multiple water resource management objectives, the DRBC and its partners have undertaken (and continue to pursue) a wide range of initiatives, including:

1. Developing and implementing comprehensive water resource plans, policies, and regulations to guide the sustainable use and protection of the basin's water resources.
2. Investing in infrastructure improvements to help protect against floods and droughts.
3. Conducting research and monitoring to improve understanding of the basin and to inform decision-making and adaptive management strategies.
4. Engage with diverse stakeholders, including water users, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the public, to build consensus on water management priorities.

The Delaware River Basin's water resource planning and management have evolved significantly over the past several decades, driven by factors such as the 1960s drought, the establishment of the DRBC, and the development of innovative programs like the FFMP. Today, the basin serves as a model for integrated, collaborative, and adaptive water management, demonstrating the value of a comprehensive approach complex challenges facing our shared water resources.
