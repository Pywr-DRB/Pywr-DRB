# Pywr-DRB: An open-source Python model for water availability and drought risk assessment in the Delaware River Basin

Pywr-DRB is an open-source Python model for exploring the role of reservoir operations, transbasin diversions, minimum flow targets, and other regulatory rules on water availability and drought risk in the DRB. Pywr-DRB is designed to flexibly draw on streamflow estimates from a variety of emerging data resources, such as the National Water Model, the National Hydrologic Model, and hybrid datasets blending modeled and observed data. Pywr-DRB bridges state-of-the-art advances in large-scale hydrologic modeling with an open-source representation of the significant role played by the basin's evolving water infrastructure and management institutions.
