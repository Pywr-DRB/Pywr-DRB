# DRB Planning & Management

## Regulations & Policy
Several key regulations impact the management of water resources in the Delaware River Basin, including:

- Delaware River Basin Compact:
This compact was signed in 1961 and established the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), which manages water resources in the basin. The compact provides a framework for cooperation among the basin states and allocates water resources based on a formula that takes into account a variety of factors, including water quality and quantity.
- Flexible Flow Management Program (FFMP):
This program was established by the DRBC to manage flows in the river during periods of drought. The FFMP allows for the temporary release of water from certain reservoirs to maintain downstream flow and protect aquatic habitats.
- Water Supply Charges Program:
This program was established by the DRBC to allocate the costs of water supply among users in the basin. The program is designed to ensure that the costs of water supply are fairly distributed among users, including municipalities, industries, and agricultural users.
- Watershed Protection Program:
This program, administered by the NYCDEP, is designed to protect the quality of drinking water in the New York City watershed. The program includes a variety of measures, including land conservation, stream restoration, and water quality monitoring.

## Stakeholders
A variety of stakeholders are involved in the management of water resources in the Delaware River Basin, including:

- Delaware River Basin Commission:

- State Agencies:
Each state in the basin has a water resources agency responsible for managing water resources within the state.
- Municipalities:
Municipalities are key stakeholders in the management of water resources, as they are the primary users of water in the basin.
