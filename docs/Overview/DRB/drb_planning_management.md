# DRB Planning & Management

The Delaware River Basin is a vital resource for millions of people, along with supporting a broad range of industries and sustaining critical ecosystems. 


## Water Resource Planning & Management

Throughout the 20th century, the Delaware River Basin became increasingly industrialized, urbanized, and populated, leading to growing demands for water resources. In response, various management and planning actions were taken, including the formation of the Delaware River Basin Commission in 1961. This interstate compact agency is responsible for managing the basin’s water resources, including water quality, quantity, and allocation.

### The 1960s Drought and the Delaware River Basin Compact

In the early 1960s, the Delaware River Basin experienced a severe drought that highlighted the need for coordinated management of water resources across state lines. The drought led to significant decreases in water levels in the basin’s reservoirs, threatening water supplies for millions of people in the region.

In response to this crisis the Delaware River Basin Compact was formed in 1961. The compact established the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), consisting of New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York City, as a regulatory agency responsible for managing the basin’s water resources in a coordinated and sustainable manner.

The formation of the DRBC and the Delaware River Basin Compact marked a significant shift in water management in the region. Rather than managing water resources on a state-by-state basis, the DRBC established a framework for coordinated management and decision-making across state lines. This has led to a more integrated approach to water management in the basin, with stakeholders working together to address issues such as water quality, water quantity, and ecosystem health.

One notable example of this coordinated approach is the Flexible Flow Management Program (FFMP), which was established by the DRBC in 2006. The FFMP is a voluntary program that allows water managers to adjust water releases from reservoirs in response to changing environmental and water supply conditions. This flexible approach to water management helps to balance the needs of different stakeholders, including water supply, hydroelectric power generation, recreation, and ecosystem health.

## Regulations & Policy
Several key regulations impact the management of water resources in the Delaware River Basin, including:

- Delaware River Basin Compact:
This compact was signed in 1961 and established the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), which manages water resources in the basin. The compact provides a framework for cooperation among the basin states and allocates water resources based on a formula that takes into account a variety of factors, including water quality and quantity.
- Flexible Flow Management Program (FFMP):
This program was established by the DRBC to manage flows in the river during periods of drought. The FFMP allows for the temporary release of water from certain reservoirs to maintain downstream flow and protect aquatic habitats.
- Water Supply Charges Program:
This program was established by the DRBC to allocate the costs of water supply among users in the basin. The program is designed to ensure that the costs of water supply are fairly distributed among users, including municipalities, industries, and agricultural users.
- Watershed Protection Program:
This program, administered by the NYCDEP, is designed to protect the quality of drinking water in the New York City watershed. The program includes a variety of measures, including land conservation, stream restoration, and water quality monitoring.

## Stakeholders
A variety of stakeholders are involved in the management of water resources in the Delaware River Basin, including:

- Delaware River Basin Commission:
The DRBC is the primary regulatory body responsible for managing water resources in the basin. The commission is composed of representatives from the basin states and the federal government.
- State Agencies:
Each state in the basin has a water resources agency responsible for managing water resources within the state.
- Municipalities:
Municipalities are key stakeholders in the management of water resources, as they are the primary users of water in the basin.
- Industries:
Industries, including power generation and manufacturing, are major users of water in the basin and play a critical role in the management of water resources.
- Environmental Groups:
Environmental groups are important stakeholders in the management of water resources in the basin, as they advocate for the protection of aquatic habitats and the preservation of water quality.
