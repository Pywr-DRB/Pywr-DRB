# Hydrology of the Delaware River Basin

The Delaware River Basin is a complex system that spans over four states and provides water for millions of people, industries, and ecosystems. Understanding the hydrology of the basin is essential for effective water management and environmental protection.


## Environmental Challenges
The Delaware River Basin faces numerous environmental challenges, including water pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. The potential impacts of climate change are of particular concern as changes in precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, and increased frequency of extreme weather events may pose challenges for the water supply system.

### Sensitive Ecosystems
The Delaware River Basin contains a wide range of sensitive ecosystems. Aquatic species are particularly vulnerable to changes in the hydrologic cycle in the basin. 

Historically, the estuary in the lower basin has been impacted by low dissolved oxygen levels in the river, causing harm to aquatic species. Higher up in the basin, cold-water fish species are vulnerable to rising stream temperatures at times of low-flow and high temperature. 

### Salinity Intrusion

As sea levels rise in the DRB estuary, salt water is able to push further up-stream along the river, particularly during low-flow periods.

Monitoring and managing the salinity intrusion is necessary to ensure that salt water does not reach the Philadelphia water treatment plant. 

## Major Out of Basin Diversions
The Delaware River Basin is subject to several out-of-basin diversions, with the largest being the New York City Water Supply System, which diverts water from the Delaware River Basin to New York City. Other significant diversions include those for industrial and agricultural purposes.

## Reservoirs
The Delaware River Basin is home to several large reservoirs that play a critical role in managing the basin's water resources. These reservoirs are primarily used for water supply, flood control, and power generation, and they are located throughout the basin.

### Reservoirs that Provide Water to New York City
The NYCDEP owns and operates three large reservoirs in the Delaware River Basin that provide water to New York City: the Cannonsville Reservoir, the Pepacton Reservoir, and the Neversink Reservoir. These reservoirs, located primarily in the upper basin, have a combined storage capacity of over 570 billion gallons of water.

Water from these reservoirs is conveyed to New York City through the Delaware Aqueduct, which is the longest tunnel in the world. The aqueduct spans over 85 miles and can deliver up to 600 million gallons of water per day to the city.

### Non-NYC Reservoirs
The DRBC operates several large reservoirs in the basin, including the Beltzville Reservoir, the Blue Marsh Reservoir, and the Francis E. Walter Reservoir. These reservoirs provide water for municipal and industrial uses, as well as for recreation.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates several flood control reservoirs in the basin, including the Round Valley Reservoir and the Lake Wallenpaupack Reservoir. These reservoirs help to mitigate flooding during periods of high water flow.
