# Hydrology of the Delaware River Basin

The Delaware River Basin is a complex system that spans over four states and provides water for millions of people, industries, and ecosystems. Understanding the hydrology of the basin is essential for effective water management and environmental protection.

## Climate of the Region
The climate of the Delaware River Basin is characterized by a humid subtropical climate, with warm summers and cool winters.


## Environmental Challenges
The Delaware River Basin faces numerous environmental challenges, including water pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. Agricultural and urban runoff, industrial discharges, and wastewater treatment plants all contribute to water pollution in the basin. Habitat loss is a significant issue in the basin, with wetland and forest ecosystems being particularly vulnerable to development and fragmentation. Climate change is also a growing concern, with changes in precipitation patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events impacting the hydrology of the basin.

### Sensitive Ecosystems
The Delaware River Basin contains a wide range of sensitive ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, and aquatic habitats. These ecosystems support a diverse array of plant and animal species, many of which are threatened or endangered. The health of these ecosystems is essential for maintaining the ecological integrity of the basin and protecting its valuable resources.

## Major Out of Basin Diversions
The Delaware River Basin is subject to several out-of-basin diversions, with the largest being the New York City Water Supply System, which diverts water from the Delaware River Basin to New York City. Other significant diversions include those for industrial and agricultural purposes.

## Reservoirs
The Delaware River Basin is home to several large reservoirs that play a critical role in managing the basin's water resources. These reservoirs are primarily used for water supply, flood control, and power generation, and they are located throughout the basin.

### Reservoirs that Provide Water to New York City
The NYCDEP owns and operates three large reservoirs in the Delaware River Basin that provide water to New York City: the Cannonsville Reservoir, the Pepacton Reservoir, and the Neversink Reservoir. These reservoirs, located primarily in the upper basin, have a combined storage capacity of over 570 billion gallons of water.

Water from these reservoirs is conveyed to New York City through the Delaware Aqueduct, which is the longest tunnel in the world. The aqueduct spans over 85 miles and can deliver up to 600 million gallons of water per day to the city.

### Non-NYC Reservoirs
The DRBC operates several large reservoirs in the basin, including the Beltzville Reservoir, the Blue Marsh Reservoir, and the Francis E. Walter Reservoir. These reservoirs provide water for municipal and industrial uses, as well as for recreation.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates several flood control reservoirs in the basin, including the Round Valley Reservoir and the Lake Wallenpaupack Reservoir. These reservoirs help to mitigate flooding during periods of high water flow.

Reservoir operations in the Delaware River Basin vary depending on their primary purpose. Water supply reservoirs, such as those operated by the NYCDEP and the DRBC, are typically managed to ensure adequate storage for drought conditions and to maintain downstream water quality. Flood control reservoirs are managed to store water during periods of high flow and to release it gradually during low flow periods.

### Distribution of Reservoirs
Reservoirs in the Delaware River Basin are distributed throughout the basin, with the largest concentration located in the upper basin. This reflects the fact that the upper basin is the primary source of water for the entire basin. Reservoirs in the upper basin are managed to store water during wet periods and release it gradually during dry periods, helping to ensure a reliable water supply for downstream users.
