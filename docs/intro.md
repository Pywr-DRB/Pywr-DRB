# Pywr-DRB

```{note}
‚≠ê **New Release:** Pywr-DRB v2.0.0-beta is now available!
```

Pywr-DRB is a water resources model of the Delaware River Basin (DRB) designed to improve our understanding of water availability, drought risk, and long-term water supply planning within the Basin.

Pywr-DRB is an open-source Python model for exploring the role of reservoir operations, transbasin diversions, minimum flow targets, and other regulatory rules on water availability and drought risk in the DRB. Pywr-DRB is designed to flexibly draw on streamflow estimates from a variety of emerging data resources, such as the National Water Model, the National Hydrologic Model, and hybrid datasets blending modeled and observed data. Pywr-DRB bridges state-of-the-art advances in large-scale hydrologic modeling with an open-source representation of the significant role played by the basin's evolving water infrastructure and management institutions.

Pywr-DRB builds on the open-source Python package [Pywr](https://github.com/pywr/pywr), which provides a flexible structure for building and simulating water resource networks.

A graphical representation of the Pywr-DRB model is shown below, where every octogon represents a reservoir in the DRB:

## Training Resources

The following Jupyter Notebooks are designed to serve as training material for the `pywrdrb` package. In the future, we will share more Notebooks to highlight more advanced workflows or model features.
