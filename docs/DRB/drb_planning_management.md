# DRB Planning & Management

The Delaware River Basin is a critical water resource in the United States, serving a diverse range of water users and playing a significant role in the region's economy, ecology, and quality of life. This page provides an overview of the state and history of regulated water resource planning and management in the basin, highlighting key events, organizations, and initiatives that have shaped the basin's water management landscape.

## Water Resource Planning & Management

The Delaware River Basin is home to a wide variety of water users, including residential, agricultural, industrial, and recreational stakeholders. The basin provides drinking water to over 13.5 million people, supports a thriving agricultural sector, and sustains numerous manufacturing and energy production facilities.

### Basin Governance and Management

Following years of interstate disputes over New York City's planned diversions from the upper basin, in 1954 the US Supreme Court issue a decree in the case of *New Jersey v. New York* that established an equitable apportionment and rules for governing the shared water resources of the DRB. The decree established maximum out-of-basin diversions for New York City and New Jersey, as well as mandated releases for downstream needs. The decree also established the [Office of the Delaware River Master (ODRM)](https://webapps.usgs.gov/odrm/) within the USGS, which is tasked with administering the provision of the decree rules. Any change to the decreed rules must be approved by unanimous consent of the five Decree Parties: New York City, New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.

In 1961, the four states and the federal government established the [Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC](https://nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/DRBCprimer.pdf). The DRBC serves as an interstate-federal regulatory agency responsible for the development of coordinated, basin-wide water resource planning and management strategies. The DRBC, in consultation with the ODRM and the Decree Parties, performs cross a broad range of activities, including water quality management, water supply allocation, flood and drought mitigation, and ecosystem preservation. The DRBC's mission as outlined in the Delaware River Basin Compact is:
> "the conservation, utilization, development, management and control of water and related resources of the Delaware River Basin under a comprehensive multipurpose plan to bring the greatest benefits and produce the most efficient service in the public welfare." ([Delaware River Basin Compact](https://www.nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/compact.pdf), 1961)

The [Flexible Flow Management Program (FFMP)](https://webapps.usgs.gov/odrm/documents/ffmp/Appendix_A_FFMP-20180716-Final.pdf) is a significant agreement passed by the Decree Parties in 2007 and updated in subsequent years, most recently 2017. The FFMP specifies rules for managing the reservoirs and water resources of the basin to balance the diverse needs of water users while minimizing environmental impacts. The program, developed in collaboration with basin stakeholders, employs a dynamic approach to reservoir releases that considers factors such as water supply demands, ecological requirements, and seasonal variations.
