    "Pywr-DRB is a river basin simulation model built on top of [Pywr](https://pywr.github.io/pywr/), a flexible node-link water resource modeling framework. In Pywr, the system is represented as a network of nodes (e.g., reservoirs, rivers, demands) and links (e.g., flow pathways), where each node has operational rules and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pywr-DRB implementation represents the full Delaware River Basin, including:\n",
    "- 18 major reservoirs (e.g., Cannonsville, Pepacton, Blue Marsh)\n",
    "- Streamflow routing between sub-basins\n",
    "- Urban, agricultural, and ecological demands\n",
    "- Operating rules based on institutional agreements and historical patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations are conducted at a daily time step, using input inflow datasets to drive flow dynamics through the network. In this tutorial, you’ll create a model configuration file that encodes this structure, along with the simulation period and hydrologic forcing data.\n",
