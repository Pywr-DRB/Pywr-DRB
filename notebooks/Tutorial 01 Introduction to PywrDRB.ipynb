    "\n",
    "Before we can run any simulations, we need to create an instance of the Pywr-DRB model, which will be stored in a `.json` file.  This `.json` file will contain all the information needed to run a simulation, including:\n",
    "- Metadata such as start and end date and number of scenarios\n",
    "- Relationships between different nodes\n",
    "- Operational constrains \n",
    "- URL paths for different input sources\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These `.json` files are unique to each simulation configuration, so we can create different instances for different inflow datasets or configurations. \n",

    "We use the `pywrdrb.ModelBuilder` to create this `.json` file. \n",

    "In order to access the simulation results, you should use the `pywrdrb.Data` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "This `pywrdrb.Data` class is designed to load and store multiple different dataset types, but in this case we will focus on the output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there are multiple datasets of interest, the `pywrdrb.Data` class uses a hierarchical structure for storing this data within the `pywrdrb.Data` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "After using `pywrdrb.Data().load()`, results are stored in the class as a nested dictionary structure following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data.results_set[datatype_label][scenario_number] -> pd.DataFrame\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return a pd.DataFrame that contains the simulation data with a datetime index. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4.1 Results sets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `results_set` refers to a key referencing a specific type of variable, examples include `res_storage` (reservoir storage data) or `major_flow` (streamflow at major model nodes). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You must provide a list of `results_sets` to `pywrdrb.Data` object, these results will then be loaded and stored by the relevant attribut. For example, if you want to access the streamflow at major Pywr-DRB model nodes, then you want `results_sets = ['major_flow']`. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.4.2 Dataset label after loading\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the `pywrdrb.Data` class is designed to handle multiple datasets in a standard way.  Given this context, we include a dataset label in the hierarchical data structure after loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data.results_set[datatype_label][scenario_number] -> pd.DataFrame\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For `pywrdrb` output data, the `datatype_label` is going to be the name of the output file, with the `.hdf5` removed.  In this case, it will be `pywrdrb_output` since that is what we used for the `output_filename` earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is beneficial since we can have a single `pywrdrb.Data` object with multiple different types of simulation results using different names. \n",
