# Instructions & metadata for spatial analysis

### DRB-specific shapefiles

All files in the DRB_shapefiles/ directory were downloaded 4/22/2022 from https://www.state.nj.us/drbc/basin/map/GIS.html. This includes a watershed boundary and a collection of streamflow and precipitation gages, among other files. Note that the watershed boundary is DRB-specific, and the sub-catchments do not line up directly with USGS national HUCs.


### USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset

The WBD for 2-digit Hydrologic Unit 02, which includes the Delaware River Basin, can be downloaded using the USGS National Map Downloader, or using this link: https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/StagedProducts/Hydrography/WBD/HU2/Shape/WBD_02_HU2_Shape.zip

This dataset should be downloaded and extracted into the WBD_02/ directory so that it can be used for geospatial analysis.


### USGS National Hydrologic Dataset 

The NHD for 4-digit Hydrologic Unit 0204, which includes the Delaware River Basin, can be downloaded using the USGS National Map Downloader, or using this link: https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/StagedProducts/Hydrography/NHD/HU4/GPKG/NHD_H_0204_HU4_GPKG.zip

This dataset should be downloaded and extracted into the NHD_0204/ directory so that it can be used for geospatial analysis.
